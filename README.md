# OpenGD77CPS
CPS for the OpenGD77, OpenGD77S, OpenDM1801, and OpenRD5R firmwares based on the Radioddity CPS Community Edition (which was originally based on the official Radioddity CPS).

This repo is a fork of rogerclarkmelborune/OpenGD77CPS as of 2021-04-21, which has been deleted from GitHub.

Development of OpenGD77 appears to have resumed, with firmware and code being released at https://www.opengd77.com/downloads/. The authors have unfortunately chosen not to publish the new code on GitHub. The sole purpose of this repository is therefore to preserve the code.
